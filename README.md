PackageSize is a website that shows the **file size** from the files used within
the most common packages (including **JavaScript/CSS frameworks & libraries**).

PackageSize uses the list of packages from [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/).
The list and information is fetched from their [API](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/wiki/Extensions%2C-Plugins%2C-Resources).
