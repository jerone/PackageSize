PackageSize is a website that shows the **file size** from the files used within
the most common packages (including **JavaScript/CSS frameworks & libraries**).

PackageSize uses the list of packages from [*cdnjs*](https://cdnjs.com/).
The list and information is fetched from their [API](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/wiki/Extensions%2C-Plugins%2C-Resources).

For the design is [*Material Design for Bootstrap*](http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/bootstrap-elements.html) used, which is a [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) theme that brings the [Google Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/) to everyone's favorite front-end framework.
